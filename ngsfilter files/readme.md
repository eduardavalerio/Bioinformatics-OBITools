## NGSfilter file

ðŸ§¬ The NGSfilter file is a text file that provides sample descriptions, including sample names, positions on a plate,
primer sequences, and tag sequences, used for demultiplexing and further processing of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. 

The files were organized in this order:

| Library code | Sample number | Tags | Forward | Reverse | Plate position |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---- | ------- | ------- | -------------- |

The OBITools pipeline accept the ngsfilte on a txt or tsv file.
