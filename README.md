# Bioinformatics - eDNA sequences 🐟

> Bioinformatics steps with eDNA Metabarcoding sequences.

### OBITools pipeline 
OBITools is a suite of bioinformatics tools designed for the analysis of DNA metabarcoding data, is particularly popular in ecological and environmental studies for processing high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data.

With OBITools it is possible to:
1. **Processing raw sequencing data** (e.g., demultiplexing, quality filtering).
2. **Identifying taxa by comparing sequences to reference databases**.
3. **Analyzing ecological data** (e.g., diversity, community composition).
